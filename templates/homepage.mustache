      I&rsquo;m torn on <abbr title='nondiclosure agreements'>NDAs</abbr>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their ubiquity, and consequent familiarity, lead
      many to grossly underestimate how technical NDAs
      are and have to be, how difficult it is to write
      or pick a good one that fits a client need,
      and how much a good fit is worth.  How much
      avoidable grief an NDA can spare.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, I am, frankly, sick and
      fucking tired of charging clients meaningful
      fractions of an hour to confirm that, yes, the
      NDA they&rsquo;ve been sent is what I expected,
      obscured by no more than the usual measure of
      pointless variation, and generally not worth the
      trouble of trying to change.  Every fraction I
      spend that way is a fractoin I wouldn&rsquo;t
      trade for the money, and a step backward from
      the kind of relationship I want with my clients.
