    <p>
      <abbr title='nondiclosure agreements'>NDAs</abbr>
      are everywhere.  So it&rsquo;s hard to convince
      clients how hard is to write a good one, and how
      much a good fit is worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, I&rsquo;m sick of charging clients
      niggling fractions of a pricey hour to confirm that,
      yes, the crusty form they&rsquo;ve been sent is what
      we all expected, obscured by no more than the usual
      pointless variation.
      Clients have better use for the money, and we all
      have better use for the time.  I&rsquo;m not running
      a tollbooth.

    RxNDA is a simple Internet service for proposing
    and signing nondisclosure agreements.  It works 1-2-3:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Visit <a href=/send>the form picker</a>.  If one
      of those forms works for your need, click its
      sign-and-send link.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fill in any blanks on the form, the details for your
      signature, and at least an e-mail address for the
      other side.  Type your name again, in a special box,
      to e-sign.  Enter your credit card info and click
      the big button.
    </li>
    <li>
      The site will e-mail the other side a link
      to countersign or decline, and you a link to
      cancel. If they countersign within seven days, we
      charge your card and e-mail everybody a complete
      Word <code>.docx</code> copy of the agreement.
      We delete our record of the offer.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    There&rsquo;s no charge for sending an offer and
    canceling it, or for sending an offer that expires
    after seven days.  We delete our records of canceled
    and expired offers, too.
