      <abbr title='nondiclosure agreements'>NDAs</abbr>
      are everywhere.  Everyone gets used to throwing
      them around.  So it&rsquo;s hard to convince clients
      how hard is to write a good one, and how much a good
      fit is worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, I&rsquo;m sick of charging clients
      niggling fractions of a pricey hour to confirm that,
      yes, the crusty form they&rsquo;ve been sent is what
      we all expected, obscured by no more than the usual
      pointless variation.  Clients have better use for
      the money, and we all have better use for the time.

    RxNDA is a simple Internet service for proposing and
    signing routing commercial nondisclosure agreements.
    It works 1-2-3:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Visit <a href=/send>the form picker</a>.  Answer a
      few questions about your needs and click the big button
      to find your form.  Have your lawyer review it to
      make sure it meets your needs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fill in any blanks on the form, the details for your
      signature, and at least an e-mail address for the
      other side.  Type your name again, in a special box,
      to sign.  Enter your credit card info and click
      the big button.
    </li>
    <li>
      The site will e-mail the other side a link
      to countersign or decline, and you a link to
      cancel. If they countersign within seven days, we
      charge your card and e-mail everybody a complete
      Word <code>.docx</code> copy of the agreement.
      We delete our record of the offer.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    There&rsquo;s no charge for sending an offer and
    canceling it, or for sending an offer that expires
    after seven days.  We delete our records of canceled
    and expired offers, too.
