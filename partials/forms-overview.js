<h3>About RxNDA Forms</h3>
<p class=warning>
  Only a lawyer engaged to provide you or your company
  legal advice can tell you whether an RxNDA form, signed
  via this website, will work for you.  RxNDA forms are
  written to be quick and easy for lawyers to assess.
  Ask your lawyer first!
</p>
<p>
  RxNDA forms are nondisclosure agreements, or
  &ldquo;NDAs&rdquo;, designed for United States companies
  and individuals who may exchange confidential information
  in anticipation of routine business transactions or
  collaborations, like sales, licenses, and service
  contracts.
</p>
<p>
  RxNDA forms are <em>not</em> designed for
  those who need non-compete, non-solicit, or no-hire
  terms, or those who may disclose highly regulated
  information, like health data or classified information.
