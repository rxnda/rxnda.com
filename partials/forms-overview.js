<h3>About RxNDA Forms</h3>
<p>
  RxNDA forms are nondisclosure agreements, or
  &ldquo;NDAs&rdquo;, designed for United States companies
  and individuals who may exchange confidential information
  in anticipation of routine business transactions or
  collaborations, like sales, licenses, and service
  contracts.
</p>
<p>
  RxNDA forms are <em>not</em> designed for
  those who need non-compete, non-solicit, or no-hire
  terms, or those who may disclose highly regulated
  information, like health data or classified information.
